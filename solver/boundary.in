### Options

BC_XBTM & BC_XTOP will be automatically set to velocity_inlet & convective outlet b.c.
unless they were set periodic boundary condition at pre-processing step.

--- For BC_YBTM ~ BC_ZTOP;
0    : Solid wall boundary condition      (zero velocity components)
1    : Far field boundary condition       (u_normal = 0, d(u_tangential)/dx_i = 0) 

ICH  : Mean flow rate condition (0; Deactivate, 1; Activate)
ITEMP: Conjugate heat transfer condition (0; Constant temp., 1; Conjugate heat transfer) 

### Caution

If periodic boundary condition(PRDIC) was already set at the ibm-preprocessing step, 
this input will be IGNORED and the periodic b.c. will be imposed preferentially.

Constant mass flow rate condition can be used for x-periodic channel flow problems.
